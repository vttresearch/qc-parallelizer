    """
    (Re)arranges a list of circuits into larger host circuits in preparation for parallel execution.
    Basically, this function combines multiple circuits into merged, wider circuits. How the
    circuits are combined depends on their connectivity and other parameters.

    Multiple backends may also be passed, but this feature is mutually exclusive with passing layout
    information for circuits.

    Args:
        circuits:
            A list of QuantumCircuit objects or (QuantumCircuit, Layout) tuples. The given circuit
            objects are copied and the originals are not modified.
        backends:
            A backend object, a list of backend objects, or a list of (backend, cost) tuples. The
            circuits will be rearranged onto these backends. In the third case, costs can be used to
            prioritize some backend by assigning lower cost to it. Backends with no associated cost
            are assumed to have unit cost (1).
        allow_ooe:
            Controls circuit ordering. Passing False forces the parallelizer to set circuits
            strictly in order - that is, a circuit that appears earlier in the list of circuits will
            be executed latest at the same time as a circuit that appears later. By default, the
            parallelizer can reorder circuits for efficiency.
        packer:
            The circuit packer to use for placing circuits onto backends. Must be a subclass of
            `packers.PackerBase` (see the `packers` module for more information). Two defaults are
            currently defined: `packers.Defaults.Fast` and `packers.Defaults.Optimal`.

    Returns:
        A dict with backends as keys and lists of packed circuits as values. You may inspect its
        contents manually, with `describe()`, or the visualization submodule, but you should not
        modify its contents. The dict is passable as is to `execute()`.
