    "### A. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain quantum computing workloads, it can be the case that there are several smaller\\*,\n",
    "independent\\*\\* quantum circuits that the user wishes to run, to for instance evaluate results in\n",
    "some parameter space. Because of the independence, the user might not care about the execution order\n",
    "or other practicalities related to how the circuits are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "With existing, commonly-used tooling, executing such a set of circuits can lead to a rather naive\n",
    "and unoptimized setting, where each circuit is run strictly sequentially. With the introduction\n",
    "of larger QPU architectures with more qubits, this becomes increasingly wasteful &mdash; especially\n",
    "if there is overhead in circuit execution, e.g. in uploading circuit data to the control electronics\n",
    "&mdash; since only a part of the chip is in use at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `qc_parallelizer` module allows the user to transform the list of circuits into larger, combined\n",
    "circuits, that pack as many user-defined circuits as the QPU can natively process. It provides a\n",
    "simple set of functions for performing this transformation as well as executing the circuits in a\n",
    "way that makes parallelization invisible to the user, by returning results from each individual\n",
    "circuit separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the user need not make any adjustments in their code &mdash; the module is intended to work\n",
    "as a direct replacement/addition for `backend.run()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*) Low circuit width, where the number of utilized qubits << number of available qubits.<br>\n",

    "- **Crosstalk**: a very densely utilized backend will probably contain physically neighboring qubits\n",
    "  that do not share any operations virtually. However, since physical coupling is fixed, slight\n",
    "  errors can be introduced between qubits that should not couple. This can be avoided, but it comes\n",
    "  at a cost of less dense packing, which leads to more circuits, which leads to longer execution\n",
    "  times.\n",
    "- **Limited parallelization due to limited connectivity**: two circuits do _not_ fit onto the same\n",
    "  backend automatically if they collectively use less qubits than what the backend supports. The\n",
    "  backend must also support coupling between qubits where it is needed, since introducing swap\n",
    "  operations within circuits has costs that outweigh the benefits (namely, lower execution time) of\n",
